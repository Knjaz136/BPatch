TODO List:
Cosmetic changes (Darkside, Shady Deals, Warhounds, Armored Supply Truck voicing)




==============================================EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS ADDED TO A GENERAL CHANGELOG LIST=====================================================
BPATCH 2.998

***GLA***

GLA Rebels and Tunnel Defenders can traverse cliffs after Infantry Boots upgrade. (Best used with Waypoint mode due to engine limitations)

GLA Lair (Sneak Attack Tunnel upgrade) cost from 1000$ to 2000$.
GLA Lair buildtime from 35 to 50 seconds.
GLA Lair now trains Rebels and Tunnel Defenders in groups of 5 and with 15% discount.
GLA Lair is permanently stealthed.

Dushka vision range reduced from 400 to 330.
When all Dushka or Stinger Site gunners/soldiers are killed, their vision range drops to 100.

Tunnel vision range further increased from 350 to 425. (vanilla - 200).
Barracks vision range from 200 to 100.
This further solidifies tunnel's role as a map awareness tool.

Tunnel health bonus from Fortification upgrade from 100% to 150%. (vanilla - 50%).
(Tunnels aren't getting their guns from vanilla, definitely not yet).

Recycler (all variants) speed increased from 40 to 45 (same as scorps/quads, so Recyclers dont slow down your army)

Demotruck Demotrap purchase cost from 200$ to 150$. (These are weaker than normal demotraps).

***Russia***

Black Bear does not benefit from Chinese Propaganda Rate of Fire bonus. 
This is done in order to soften the effect of % based healing from Propaganda, that Black Bear gets massive benefits from due to extremely high base health pool.
Black Bear base Rate of Fire decreased by additional 5%.
Black Bear AA missile base Rate of Fire decreased by additional ~7%.
Bit more tuning to Black Bear.


Kashtan vision range reduced from 500 to 360. (average among all defenses in game).
Radar outpost vision range increased from 200 to 300. 
Doesn't make sense for the Radar to have such a low vision range. Observation Post is still vastly superior with it's 600 range.


***USA***
Drone Hive vision range increased from 360 to 450.
Meant to be highest vision range/highest range Tier 1 base defense in game.

TMD will not target Gepard/Skyshield projectils anymore.

***ECA***
Guard Tower vision range increased from 360 to 400. 
It's a tower, after all.

Howitzer positions show remaining ammo, as in vanilla.

Fenris anti-infantry damage type from Poison to MELEE. Sorry, ChemSuits.
Fenris armorset changed from TankArmor to BuratinoTankArmor (less damage from anti-tank infantry).

Wotan Array speed from 30 to 40.
Wotan Array turn rate from 90 to 130. 
Wotans are already performing very fine against normal aircraft - hence I cannot change their damage or range values any further,
 but at same time they noticeably underperform vs GP Planes, without excelling at much else.  So instead this unit is given it's own identity and advantages over other T2 AA,
making it the most mobile T2 AA out of them all, which should help to keep up with the rest of ECA's ground force when it decides to go on offensive and properly positioning Wotans for GP Plane kill.

Mammoth Tank (w/ Manticore Protocol)
Healing delay from 2 seconds to 1 seconds.
Healing amount from 20 to 25. 
Further polishing of MT stats.

***China***
Bunker vision range from 360 to 320.

EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE (rollback or nerfs are likely):
Hopper Tanks does not anymore receive total of 40% dmg increase increase from Uranium Shells. (vanilla - 25%).

Tank description changed accordingly.

***Global***
PropagandaStructureArmor resistance values
EXPLOSION from 100% to 85%
AURORA_BOMB from 125% to 150%. 

This armorset is used for specific tier buildings among various factions. I equalized Explosion resistance with StructureArmorTough, used for other tier buildings.
WHile at same time addressed their insane AURORA_BOMB resists (normally buildings get 200%, and unit damage output is balanced around that) which don't seem to be making much sense in this day and age, if not being outright zh leftovers.


bugfix: bounties properly work from command truck and do not require BM anymore.
bugfix: dummy weapons should stop attacking things they shouldn't attack.
AI: russian industrial plant commandset done for mizo
technical: some memory pool/network value changes.
bugfix: TMD does not attack Skyshield rounds anymore.

Infantry Boots increase Rebel speed by 20%. (from 25 to 30)

Propaganda Airship health reduced by 33%.

Propaganda Airship damage output  vs air targets increased by 20%.

Propaganda Airship requires Mass Mobilization GP. 
Propaganda Airship requires Propaganda Center instead of Breeder Reactor.

War Propaganda does not heal units anymore until Nationalism upgrade is researched.


***ECA***
Gun Turret/Mortar Pit Tier swap experiment is over, all changes rolled back due to issues with Dragon Tank INF_MISSILE resistance combined with anti-building damage.

(CREDITS: Enigma (author of "Babushka Revenge" modification for Rise of the Reds) for ECA colors, voicing taken from Shockwave mod)
Gameplay wise, these things allow for a new combinations in GP tree development for ECA players that went more agressive route upon reaching mid- and early late-game, and make faction slightly easier to understand for newer players, unfamiliar with concept of "Defense/Turtler/Crawler" faction in RTS games.
This unit does (should-) not break the general weaknesses and strengths of the faction, as per combination of price, firepower, range and other stats this is not an Overlord equivalent.

Tear Gas hotkey changed from G to ` (was interfering with Guard mode hotkey).

;================================================================

Global (sorta) - all scouts units now provide drastically increased amount of experience. Mindlessly sacrificing your scout units into opponent will quickly bite you back.
Amount of experience is decided by scout's units usefulness, faction it belongs to and other roles said scout unit could have.

***GLA***

MortarTrack armorset from TankArmor to ERATankArmor.



===============================================================================
BPatch 2.991
Global: Instead of bringing up dropzones from 2.0, temporarily replaced them with oil wells. 
Reasoning - those are often placed at secondary supply spot, but their relatively low income/minute considerably slows down the game. 
Boosting their income to that of a full-fledged supply option will result in potential negative effects on those maps where Supply Zones are properly placed as possible expansion points.


***Russia***
Sentinel production time increased from 25 to 30 seconds. 
Makes it slightly harder to field Sentinel deathball.


***GLA***
Command Truck speed equalized with worker speed.

-------------------------------------------------------------
BPatch 2.990A
Bugfix:
Fanaticism now properly boosts range to 7%, instead of 10%.

***USA***
EXPERIMENT: Bradleys do not require Veteran Company for now. While this change certainly has potential to unbalance the faction and matchups,
I feel like Bradleys create way too much strategies/unit synergies within faction to keep them locked.

USA Command Center now produces 3 power. 
Been noticing there's a specific window in early game as US when players often find themselves lacking 1-2 power, which doesn't bode well with drone-centric strategies.

Razor bombers now deal increased damage to infantry targets in it's AoE. Will one-shot everything up to a Felin in it's secondary AoE.
May be later reverted/scaled down later.
Razor Bomber description updated.

Starlifter repair AoE further increased by 25%.
Makes it easier to properly position them over your units.

USA Sentry Drone health bonus after Drone Armor upgrade from 100 to 75.
USA Sentry Drones do not get new ArmorSet after Drone Armor upgrade, anymore.

***ECA***
Jagdmammuts do not require Bundeswehr Elites (Field Promotion) anymore. 
Jagdmammuts are not stealthed when standing still by default anymore. 
Ambush Tactics upgrade introduced, requires Bundeswehr Elites GP, makes Jagdmammuts stealthed when standing still.
Should make things feel more vanilla for newcomers, also helps ECA vs Sentspam.

***GLA***

GLA Barracks now receive 5 times more damage from GATTLING, 20% more from SMALL_ARMS.
GLA worker buildtime from Hideout from 3 to 5 seconds. If this change will be too critical, it will get rolled back.
GLA Worker buildtime in Supply Stash unchanged.
Tested, Warfactory timings did not change IF first worker is used on a supply.
GLA Hole armorset to same as of Barracks.

Mercenary Grenadiers fire in burst shots of 3 after DS upgrade, Damage per Minute remains the same.

ECA dozers benefit from Armor Skirts upgrade, +50% health.
ECA dozer speed increase from 2.92 cancelled and rolled back to BP levels.
