REQUIRES RISE OF THE REDS 1.87 PUBLIC BUILD 2.0

In a folder, where Rise of the Reds 1.87, find the file called!!Rotr_Intrnl_INI.gib
This is an archive with all unit stats from 1.87, REMOVE or MOVE it away to some place, for example to Desktop.

Put !!!Rotr_Intrnl_INI_BP_2.998-1.big into the folder.
When launching the game, it's highly RECOMMENDED to select QUICKSTART option.
Enjoy.

OPTIONAL FILES:
GrimTuesdayUI - same UI as the one I'm using.
FasterMenu - a simple tweak I made to reduce time for main menu window transition.
