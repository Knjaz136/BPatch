GLA. A "Guerilla warfare" faction ended up playing as a combination of ECA and China, defense rushing it's opponents and 

====================== BUGFIXES ==================================

Black Market Merchants are properly affected by GPS Scrambler.

==================================================================== GROUND UNITS ==========================================================
Worker construction hotkey from K to D
GLA worker buildtime from Hideout from 3 to 5 seconds. If this change will be too critical, it will get rolled back.
GLA Worker buildtime in Supply Stash unchanged.
Tested, Warfactory timings did not change IF first worker is used on a supply.
This was changed to keep BPatch's GLA early game expansion timings under control, especially barracks rush. 
Removing tunnel from the barracks is seen as a last resort solution that will not be implemented for now.

Rebel cost increased from 65$ to 75$. (was borderline too good, new changes were the last straw).
Major changes to basic GLA infantry, read "UPGRADES" section.

Hijacker requires Arms Dealer to be built.
Hiajcker buildtime increased from 10 to 11 seconds.
Changes overly good timings on hijacker supply rush in hands of top players.

Stinger Soldier's pistol disabled. Works alot better out of battlebusses now.

Anarchists do not deal damage to surroundings upon death.
Anarchist mine duration from 30 to 90 seconds.
Anarchists receive +33% movement speed from Arm the Mob upgrade.


Stinger Soldier cost from 300 to 250$.
Fanatical devotion increases stinger soldier speed to 25%.

Mercenaries lose only 10% speed when heavily injured.

+Mercenary Runner cost from 200 to 250.
+MErcenary Runner buildtime from 7 to 2 seconds.
Mercenary Runner requires Arms Dealer.
MercenaryRunner damage type after AP bullets upgrade from GATTLING to SMALL_ARMS
MercenaryRunner range from 150 to 130.
Mercenary Runner shotgun gets only half of Combat Drug bonus.

+Mercenary Gunner cost from 500 to 625.
+Mercenary Gunner buildtime from 9 to 2.5 seconds.
+Mercenary Gunner (prone mode) get 15% dmg bonus from Combat Drugs, instead of ROF.
Done because both of these have ways of having fuckton hp, thus practically nullifying negative effects of Combat Drugs.

+Mercenary Grenadier price from 725 to 750$.
+Mercenary Grenadier buildtime from 10 to 2.5 seconds.
+Mercenary Grenadier direct fire mode DBS from 3.0 seconds to 2.5 seconds.
+Mercenary Grenadier gets only +30% ROF bonus from Combat Drugs, instead of 50%.
+Mercenary Grenadiers fire in burst shots of 3 after DarkSide upgrade, Damage per Minute remains the same.

Angry mobs move more coherently.
Angry mobs are same as in older RotR. Still perfectly viable and often used unit.


Command Truck made slower until Tier 1 upgrade, so it doesn't break tier 0 timings.

Observation Van default health reduced from 300 to 150.
Observation Van receives +150 health from Observation Scanners upgrade.
Observation Vans detect Demotraps and Mines by default.
Observation Van experience from 5 to 30. (have to keep reltively low since they are also used as decoys, and meant to be spammed).

Technical basic MG range from 150 to 130.
Technical default MG damage type from GATTLING to COMANCHE_VULCAN
Technicals receive 15% range boost from AP Ammo upgrade.
Technicals are built with Level 1 Salvage after AP Ammo upgrade. (Credits: Hanfield)
Technical price from 500 to 450$
Technical buildtime from 8 to 7 seconds.
Technical health from 180 to 130.
Technical experiencevalue changed from 30 30 50 100 to 20 20 40 80
Technicals only drop GLA salvage on Elite/Heroic rank. (This is done to prevent technical salvage snowball on Tier 0, reduce probability of game being decided in 2.5 minutes after beginning and make GLA mirrors more diverse.)

The combined result is such: Technicals can gun down buildings and dozers from get go. Technical is not anymore a unit you only see during first moments of the game. It stays viable and has it's uses during entiretey of the game,
as it has the best dps/cost investment, fast speed, and it's price and, most importantly, experience values allow player to take massive losses without being afraid of giving too much Experience to opponents.
Right now, this vehicle has the lowest amount of experience feed to the opponent in entire game.
At same time, large health reduction on Tier 0 means technicals cannot be spammed to bruteforce humvees, this matchup was completely reversed.
Use bikes vs Humvees (and check USA changelog if you're interested in that matchup, there're additional explanations in there and armorset changes)


+Quad
Cost from 800 to 700.
Damage vs ground targets reduced by 10%, from 10 to 9 (from 12.5 to 11.3, 15.0 to 12.5 for salvage)
Speed increased from 40 to 45.
SpeedDamaged from 25 to 35.
SpeedUpgraded from 60 to 65, 40 to 45. (Chinese Recycler tech).
Quad tank anti-ground range from 150 to 136.
AP Bullets provide additional +10% to QuadTank's anti-ground AND anti-air range.
Quad Cannon AA damage from 5 to 6.
Quad cannon canister round AA damage from 8 to 9
Quad Cannon Salvage level 1 anti-ground damage reduced from 11.3 to 10.5
Quad Cannon Salvage level 2 AA damage from 9 to 8.
Quad Cannon Salvage level 2 anti-ground damage reduced from 12.5 to 12

First half of these changes are the oldest of BP changes. ROtR testers often complained about how Quadspam bruteforces anything on Tier 0. 
As a result, their anti-ground range was reduced until AP Ammo upgrade. 
At same time, GLA always had issues against USA airforce starting from midgame (as well as thermobaric hellion hit n runs), and as the game progressed, these issues became progressively worse, due to
existence of Countermeasure mechanic. Quad AA efficiency was increased (their default damage output in vanilla is THE LOWEST among all T0 AA units). 
Lastly, Quad salvage snowball capabilities were nerfed, so those Level 2 Salvage Heroic Quads are a bit less brutal than before.

+SCORPION TANK:
Health from 370 to 270.
Cost from 800 to 600
Scorpion tank gun damage increased from 22.5/30/40 to 30/40/54 (normal/salvage1/salvage2)
BTime from 8 to 6
Speed from 40 to 45
Speed damaged from 30 to 35
Hover speed from 70 to 85
HoverSpeedDamaged from 55 to 75
Scorpion rocket to T1. 
Scorpion rocket damage decreased by 40%.
Scorpion rocket secondary damage aoe decreased from 25 to 20.
Scorpion rocket receives +100% bonus from AP_Rockets, instead of +25%.
Scorpion rocket speed from 600 to 800.
Scorpions now have full Rate of Fire on the move.
Scorpion Missile speed cooldown from 15 to 10 seconds.
Scorpion Missile maxspeed from 150 to 200, minspeed from 120 to 160.
AP Rockets upgrade doubles Scorpion Missile Speed.
Scorpion armorset changed from TankArmor to LightTankArmor 
_Receives 28% less damage from Poison, to reduce efficiency of Toxin Tractors as tank counters, as light tanks are small and are vulnerable to Toxin Tractor's splash damage_

Scorpion speed is equalized with Quads so both units operate together and do not slow each other down. 
Scorpions are thus remade into light tanks, more fitting the theme of GLA, with cheap price, fast production speed, 
fast default movement speed starting from Tier 0, +20% per shot damage on maingun, cheap and quickly accessible Scorpion Rocket upgrade on Tier 1
in Black Market, but a lower health. 
All combined, these 3 changes (Technicals, Quads and Scorps) gives GLA ground force a unique feel that matches faction theme of mobility, firepower and guerilla warfare.


Scorpionturret turn rate increased by 60% and equalized with that of Paladin. (from 100 to 160)
Marauder turret turn rate increased by 60% and equalized with that of Paladin. (from 100 to 160)
Marauder Junkrepair healrate increased by ~100%. Heals itself to full health in ~60, to half health in ~30 seconds. 

Marauder can heal itself outside of combat (has to wait for 4 seconds after receiving damage). 30 seconds to heal to half health. 
Marauder price from 1100$ to 1200$. 
Stacks with Junk Repair. Junk Repair also has massively increased healrate for marauder (9hp per second), but works during combat as well.
Pretty big change that made Marauders awesome due to being able to sustain their assault. This change was later implemented into original RotR 1.87, but in an incomplete form.

Marauder Salvage Level 1 and Level 2 reload time increased by 10%. (still lower than non-salvaged marauder).
Slight nerf to salvaged versions of Marauders

Bikes have original price of 500$. (No clue who's idea it was to reduce them to 400$, but that wasn't need).
Do note that they currently have increased efficiency vs Russia (stealth detection changes, subject to change again) and USA.

Toxin Tractor receives 25% more damage from tank guns. (ARMOR_PIERCING, STEALTHJET_MISSILE 125%). It was performing better at anti-tank duty than it should have.

DemoTruck from 1000$ to 900$
DemoTruck damage type from EXPLOSION to Aurora_bomb. It takes out in 1 hit almost any defense in game except for the toughest ones. 
Demotrucks require Demo GP.
Demotrucks moved to Tier 2.
Demotruck Demotrap detonation distance from 30 to 40. (same as demotrap). 
Demotruck demotrap secondary damage from 150 to 200 (50% of the Demotrap's)
Demotruck Demotrap purchase cost from 200$ to 150$. (These are weaker than normal demotraps).


Battlebus stats are brought to RotR 1.87-PB2.0 build, base BBus cost reduced by 250$, Tunnel Defenders removed. (-1000$) 
(resulting purchase cost: 750$)

Bombtrucks available by default at Tier 2, bombtruck loadouts locked behind GP. 
Bombtruck cost from 700 to 900.
Bombtruck base damage from 1500 to 1000.

+++Ok, that's a big one, but all the GLA faction buffs in BP were meant to lead to this point.
GLA Buggy experience value from 50 50 100 150 to 70 70 100 150
Rocket Buggy missile projectile health from 100 to 20. (they get killed by Arena splash damage).
Buggy mortar damage type from ARMOR_PIERCING to EXPLOSION.
Buggy mortar infantry killing module is disabled.
Buggy speed reduced from 90 to 80, speeddamaged from 80 to 70.
Rocket Buggies cannot fire their precise rocket salvos while on the move.
Rocket Buggy cost from 900$ to 1000$.
Buggy Ammo Upgrade cost from 1000$ to 2500$

Still perfectly viable, as tests show. But not as powerful as before. Given numerous other options and build orders, we have games where you do not even need to build buggies.

BM21 Grad speed from 30 to 40. 
BM21 Grad turnrate from 63 to 90.
-This is same as vanilla 1.87 grad speed buff.
Grad health reduced from 200 to 150, to accomodate for it's greatly increased mobility. Otherwise, mobility needs to be reverted back to older versions.
BM21 Grad minrange from 150 to 200. Done due to mobility changes and resulting capabilities of grads to evade opponent ground units.

Ural Truck buildtime from 18 to 14 seconds.
Ural vision range increased from 200 to 350. Underlines its ambush-oriented nature.



Recycler price from 1400$ to 1700$.
Instead of applying heavy nerfs left and right to fit their low-ish pricetag, this allows us to scale up lacking recyclers. Tests ongoing. (and need more of them, to be honest)
Recycler experience values tweaked.
Recycler (all variants) speed increased from 40 to 45 (same as scorps/quads, so Recyclers dont slow down your army)

Toxin Recycler experience value from 50 to 300.
Toxin Recycler health from 400 to 300.
Tesla Recycler damage output reduced by 25%-30%. Practically no effect on it's effectiveness against infantry.

ToxinRecyclerPoisonFieldWeapon from 15 to 22. AnthraxBeta from 20 to 33.
ToxinRecycler field duration from 60 to 12 seconds.
-Heavy nerf, but the thing is so broken even it didn't help as tests showed. Hence this happened as a temporary solution:
Toxin Recycler swapped with Tremor Recycler in faction requirements until it's decided what to do with toxin recycler. (I.e., Russian Tier 2 for Toxin recycler, and GLA Tier 2 for Tremor one).

GLA Eca Tier 1 Recycler range increased from 210 to 230. (projectile lifetime +10%).

==================================================================== BUILDINGS ==========================================================
All GLA production buildings that have tunnel function now can evacuate without switching commandsets, but cannot choose which units to evacuate.
Barracks, Warfactory, Hideout do not need to cancel their production to evacuate units.

Dushkas require Arms Dealer to be built.
Dushka vision range reduced from 400 to 330.
When all Dushka or Stinger Site gunners/soldiers are killed, their vision range drops to 100.

GLA Barracks buildtime from 15 to 10 seconds nominal. It is +- equalized with other factions, and that is taking into account low power debuff GLA always has.
Experimental, could be reverted if turns out to be problematic with the agressive use of rax as a faster-constructing tunnel in front/behind enemy base.
GLA Barracks health from 1000 to 750.
GLA Barracks hole health from 500 to 250.
GLA Barracks now receive 5 times more damage from GATTLING (from 10 to 50%), 20% more from SMALL_ARMS. (from 50% to 60%).
Barracks vision range from 200 to 100. This further solidifies tunnel's role as a map awareness tool.

This is done to increase amount of units capable of effectively eliminating forward GLA barracks. Gattling tanks, tunguskas, everything else.
Combined with Tunnel changes, makes barracks clearly inferior to dedicated Tunnel, but without removing tunnel mechanic from them.
GLA Hole armorset to same as of Barracks.


Supply Stash comes with 4 workers.
Supply Stash buildtime from 15 to 20 seconds 
Supply Stash cost from 1500 to 1800$.

Demotraps
Cost from 300 to 250$
Detection range vs primary detectors of all factions increased by ~35%.
Demotraps restealth themselves in 1 second, instead of 30 times per second. 
This is what probably prevented units from auto-attacking them on detection.

GLA Defence Camo upgrade does not require Camouflage upgrade from Black MArket.
Since tunnel is tier 1, it's not a problem anymore.

Tunnel Network requires Black Market.
Tunnel Network cost from 700$ to 300$.
Tunnel vision range further increased from 200 to 425. (vanilla - 200). 
This allows Tunnels to keep GLA player aware of what is going on around them and act as stealthed map awareness mechanic at same time.
Tunnel health bonus from Fortification upgrade from 100% to 150%. (vanilla - 50%).
(Tunnels aren't getting their guns from vanilla, definitely not yet at least.)


GLA Lair (Sneak Attack Tunnel upgrade) cost from 1000$ to 2000$.
GLA Lair buildtime from 35 to 50 seconds.
GLA Lair now trains Rebels and Tunnel Defenders in groups of 5 and with 15% discount.
GLA Lair is permanently stealthed.


SCUD Storm cost from 4000 to 8000.
SCUD Storm health from 4000 to 8000
SCUD Storm buildtime from 45 to 80 seconds.
SCUD Storm cooldown from 8 to 9 minutes.

==================================================================== AIR UNITS ==========================================================
No changes for now.
====================================================================UPGRADES ==========================================================


Fanatical Devotion does not anymore increase Tunnel Defender, Stinger Soldier and RPG Insurgent movespeed by 25%.

Worker Shoes cost from 1000$ to 1500$, research time from 10 to 40 seconds. After all changes to other upgrades (read below) and units, we finally reached a point where Worker shoes dont need to be a number 1 upgrade pick 100% of the time.
Worker Shoes renamed to infantry boots.
Infantry Boots increase Rebel speed by 20%. (from 25 to 30)
Infantry Boots increase Tunnel Defender speed by 40%. (from 20 to 28)
Infantry Boots increase Stinger Soldier speed by 25%. (from 20 to 25)
Infantry Boots increase RPG Insurgent speed by 25% (from 20 to 25)
GLA Rebels and Tunnel Defenders can traverse cliffs after Infantry Boots upgrade. (Best used with Waypoint mode due to engine limitations)

One of the later changes, this nicely complements GLA Theme and gives faction more unique feel. Now GLA has the fastest mobile basic infantry units in the game 
(and in terms of missile infantry - massively faster than opposition missilke infantry). 
This is currently ongoing testing and so far things look like a nerf will be required. But to keep things within faction theme, potential nerfs include health reduction, cost or Re-stealth delay nerfs. 
Damage output and unit going to stay as it is.

Combat drugs GP unlocks Stimpaks upgrade.
Stimpaks upgrade gives all GLA infantry passive healing like Russian medkits do (+20% healrate vs medkits), outside of combat (1 second without receiving damage), but in small bursts.
Great synergy with life-consuming drug usage.

Armor Piercing Ammo upgrade cost from 2000$ to 1500$, research time from 60 to 40 seconds.
Black Market shares AP Ammo upgrade with Chemical Lab.
Armor Piercing Ammunition Upgrade research time further reduced from 40 to 30 seconds.
Technicals are built with first level of salvage after AP Ammo upgrade. (Credits: Hanfield)


Scorpion Rocket upgrade available from Black Market.
Scorpion Rocket Upgrade research time reduced from 30 to 25 second.

+Camouflage upgrade cost from 1500 to 1000$
+Research time from 45 to 30 seconds.

Buggy Ammo Upgrade cost from 1000$ to 2500$
Buggy Ammo upgrade research time from 30 to 45 seconds.

Observation Scanners upgrade increases Command Truck speed by 50%.

Radar Van Scan cooldown from 25 to 50 seconds.
Radar Van Scan map reveal radius from 220 to 400.
(Few words here - one of the oldest changes, works really well with helping GLA to select the vector for attacking/harassing enemy base. It reveals almost entire flank).

Fanatical devotion increases Tunnel Defender, RPG Insurgent speed by 25%.


==================================================================== GENERAL POWERS ==========================================================

+Heavy Explosives GP now increases Terrorist and Demotrap explosion radius by 15%. (Credits: Hanfield)

Combat Drugs GP power cooldown from 2 minutes to 1 minute.
Combat Drugs health damage from 30 to 49.
Combat Drugs received a hotkey -  ` (button to the left from 1)`
Combat Drugs unlock Stimpaks upgrade.

Sabotage animation fixed. (by Hanfield).
Sabotage duration reduced from 10/15/20 to 5/10/15 seconds. One of few rare IWin buttons out there, deserved a nerf.
Sabotage damage changed from 50/100/150 damage to 75/100/150 damage.

GPSS Station Stealth radius from 275 to 310.
Helps them a bit after they became visible in vanilla.

GPS Scrambler Truck price from 1200 to 2400$.
GPS Scrambler Truck experience value from 5 to 150. 
GPSS Truck buildtime from 10 to 15 seconds.
GPSS Truck Stealth Field radius from 135 to 125.
GPSS Truck is permastealthed. (Detectable by stealth detection, doesn't reveal itself at all when firing it's dummyweapon or being fired at)
GPSS Truck Vision range to 600. (equal to that of Observation van, as Obs. van can't be stealthed by GPSS mechanic). 
GPSS Truck detects stealth like Observation Van does.
GPSS Truck dummy weapon range from 210 to 360. Alot easier to use with Arty, also makes Trucks always stay behind your force when ordered to attack move, because they attempt to "shoot" enemy with fake weapon.
GPSS Truck Junk repair effect to ~ Marauder level. (for Junk repair only, does not have Marauder's innate self-repair)
GPSS Jammer special ability hotkey from J to C (Jammer works best on smaller units and arty, worst on larger units like Overlords).

High price prohibits it's use as stealthed stationary GPS Scrambler, while it's permastealth brings life into that unit once again, and combined with it's
stealth detection and vision range capabilities (Remember- Observation Vans CANNOT be stealthed! Same for all units with disguise ability), it allows you to move stealthed attack groups around.
Works best with stealthed BM21 Grad groups hit n run.

================================================================
Dark Side Upgrade added, requires Rank 5 and GLA as a main faction, available from Hideout.
 
A few words first. This was added as an experiment initially, to check how
1) GLA gameplay would look like without artillery, which was always a major complaint about RotR players for years.
2) To test out stuff that is not being used often in actual games. All those secondary recycler upgrades and so on.
To this moment, upgrade name and upgrade button visuals weren't finalized, but GLA players really did like it's introduction so much that it stayed on permanent basis. 
Now, to what it does:

!!!!WARNING, EFFECTS OF THIS UPGRADE CANNOT BE REVERSED.!!!

Forbids construction of GLA artillery Recyclers, Grads, Buggies, as well as artillery of other factions.
DarkSide automatically removes all buggies, grads and artillery recyclers from players posession. (credits: Hanfield)
Mercenary Grenadiers lose their arc attack mode, but their ground attack mode gets enhanced.
Quad Cannon, Dushka and Stinger Site health reduced by 20%.


Gives all existing ground unit Rank 1 unlocks and Recycler technologies.
Provides 50% Bounty for killed enemy units regardless if Bounties were researched before.
Chemical lab produces power.
+100% Black Market Merchant income after Shady Deals upgrade. (unlocked by Dark Side upgrade).
+100% Black Market Health.
