Bugfix: Grumbles are not targeted by Skyshields anymore. Only way to prevent Grumble missile detonation when colliding with SKyshield's projectile so far.

Russia. This faction received most changes compared to vanilla faction. The addition of units from several generals, as well as less optimal balance decisions started to slowly erase this faction's original gameplay theme.
Instead of being powerful and slow steamroller it was initially meant to be by mod developer, with clear set of strengths and weaknesses, it started moving closer to jack of all trades with steamrolling capabilities on top.
Having it's entire gunship roster taken from "Trickster" theme Russian general (the one that has gameplay opposite to default faction) was bad enough, but cheap BMPs, only Tier 1 fireport unit in the game and finally addition of Bombadiers broke things further.

Among other things, RotR testers always complained about 50$ basic infantry stealth detecting everything was overpowered, it was addressed.
Kodiak,  Golem and Sentinel tanks were moved further away from each other, to give each unit a better identity, so that player wouldn't feel he has "more of the same", or that one option is clearly and always superior to another.
Specific imbalanced (especially in low-to medium skilled games) tactics were either rebalanced or axed entirely.

I know above may sound scary for Russia players, but things were done to compensate for the loss of other things, and resulting effect is a faction which gameplay is alot closer to original SWR design and description.

==================================================================== GROUND UNITS ==========================================================
Infrared Goggles renamed to Infrared Optics.
Conscript's stealth detection is ECA dog-like now (litteral copy-pasted stats). With the addition of still detecting from garrisons and transports.
+Conscripts detect mines and demotraps 3 times per second, instead of 10 times per second. FPS change on test map with 1000 conscritps around from 33 to 64 if you look away, or from 26 to 35 if you look at that blob.
+Conscripts do not get their models upgraded with infrared googles. Unknown amounts of fps gains due to inability to test properly.

Shmel trooper smoke grenade hotkey changed from M to C.
Shmel post-upgrade weapon received a minor buff. (+7% AoE damage).

Shocktroopers require Shock Division GP.
Shocktroopers cost from 500$ to 450$.
Shocktrooper buildtime from 8 to 7. (same as in Vanilla).
Shocktrooper experience requirement for ranking up from 0 300 400 600 (3 sentinels or 5 kodiaks for heroic), to 0 150 250 450
Shocktrooper healing amount from medkits from 2 to 5/second. (time to heal half hp - from 62 to 25 seconds).
Shocktroopers got different firing sound.
Shocktrooper AoE from 2.0 to 6.0 (very minor, mainly vs stacked infantry).
Scatter radius of 5 added. Looks better visually, imho. They dont miss their damage on infantry as they have AoE of 5 by default in BP.
Shocktroopers benefit from Coil Guns. 
Shocktroopers become more efficient against explosion-resistant vehicles after Coil Guns upgrade, as they use Armor-Piercing damage against them.
Shocktrooper Tesla gun cannot disable vehicles or buildings anymore.
Shocktrooper Tesla gun range reduced from 140 to 70. (that's half the range of a conscript, point blank basically).
Shocktrooper Tesla gun fires in bursts of 6 shots. (only matters when killing infantry)
Shocktrooper Tesla esla gun provides 50% more DPS than Rifle/CoilRifle mode, overall damage output is similar to that of Tesla Tank.
Coilgun upgrade increases Tesla gun range from 70 to 105. (conscript range is 130, for reference), Rifle Range from 180 to 190.
Shocktrooper Rocket Rifle hotkey from O to R.

Bombardier requires Shock Division GP.
Bombardier secondary damage reduced to 62% of Primary one. (from 40 to 25, was 100% in Vanilla, which is weird occurence).
Bombardier burst mode scatter radius from 30 to 45.
Shocktrooper Bombadier burst mode reload time further to 7.6 seconds. (from 6.0 in vanilla, total 26% reload time increase).
Bombardier cost from 500 to 600.
Bombardier requires Tier 2.
Bombardier healing from medkits from 2/sec to 5/sec (same as normal Shocktrooper in BPatch).
Bombardier health is 250. (current vanilla setting is 200).

A Tier 1 bombardier broke alot of matchups, goes to Tier 2 now.
Shocktroopers were the prime candidates to get locked behind a GP, as Goliath is default now (and nerfed by half in it's duration, and it's a must-have anyway in specific matchups), and Hind is a moved to a different R5 GP.

VDV Gunner ExperienceValue from 40/40/70/90 to 20/20/40/60, equalized with that of VDV RPG Trooper.
VDV gunner ammo clip from 12 to 10.
VDV Guner clipreload time from 1000 to 1250.
VDV Gunner damage type from GATTLING to SMALL_ARMS.
VDV Gunners do not get ROF boost from Veterancy, they get damage boost instead. (prevents them from breaking RoF threshold and shooting 2 times faster)

VDV RPG tooper Thermobaric launcher clipreloadtime from 3500 to 3000. (they still have their high pre-fire delay).
VDV RPG cost from 300 to 350$.
VDV RPGs do not get veterancy ROF bonus to Thermobarics

VDV infantry speed from 25 to 28.

Boris Grenade Launcher primary damage from 50 to 65, secondary damage from 25 to 35.
Boris Grenade Launcher projectile speed from 200 to 140.
Support Loadout renamed to Siege Loadout.
A rather underused ability, except vs buildings, received slight buffs.

Bugfix:
Once RPG Boris starts locking on target with aimed shot, it will shoot even if target goes out of range. (Credits: Hanfield)
Done  to prevent critical errors.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Russia supply truck cost from 900$ to 800$

Kodiak buildtime from 17 to 15.
Kodiak TurretTurnRate reduced by 11% and equalized with that of Paladin. (from 180 to 160).
Kodiak ExperienceValue from 150 150 250 500 to 125 125 200 400 
Kodiak ATGM dmg from 110 to 120, DBS from 3000 to 3200.
Kodiak health from 700 to 710. (USA-Russia matchups specifically, increasing Shots-to-Kill for Kodiak by one.)
This makes relying on Kodiaks' in Russia's early game a more viable approach, with more sane buildtime stats.


Mishka ExperienceValue from 5 to 50. 
Mishkas lost their fireports in order to benefit from Infrared Googles upgrade and act as stealth detectors. 
Mishkas benefit from Infrared Optics. 
Mishkas,after IR Optics, can detect stealth at same ranges/with same capability as other faction's main stealth detectors.
Mishka health reduced from 200 to 150.
Mishka bonus health from ERA increased from 100 to 150.
Mishka now has stealth detection range indicator. (currently - by default, which means it has one even if IROptics are not yet researched).
Small tooltip tweaks.

BMP smoke ability locked behind "Light Weapon Systems" (previously known as Assault Armaments)
BMP buildtime from 9 to 8. 
BMP cost from 800$ to 900$.
800$ BMP spam with a quick tier 1 upgrade was giving impression of playing completely different faction, on top of rolling over factions like GLA.
Smokes removed until Tier 1, as Smokes provide massive synergy with infantry based tactics.


Tunguska, Grizzly Smoke ability locked behind "Light Weapon System"
Tunguska missile AoE from 5 to 10. Will be completely unnoticeable for 95% engagements.
Tunguskas now properly receive 15% damage buff to their anti-ground autocannons after upgrade. (bugfix)
Tunguska health changed from 420 to 430.
Tunguska fires 2 missiles each 2 seconds instead of 4 missiles each 4 seconds.
Tunguska max missile speed from 400 to 500, min missile speed from 120 to 300, acceleration unchanged.
Tunguska AI guard mode from 250 to 300.
Tunguskas require Light Weapon Systems upgrade to fire smoke grenades.


+Grizzly unupgraded damage output equalized with upgraded version (from 10 to 15 on both SMALL_ARMS and SURRENDER weapon).
+Grizzly pre-upgrade range from 160 to 150. 
+Grizzly post-upgrade range from 150 to 175.
+Grizzly speed from 30 to 25. (doesn't need more, Kodiaks/Golems/Sents dont go faster).
+Grizzly buildtime from 8 to 10.
+Grizzly detects stealthed infantry, mines, demotraps and vehicles by default. 
+Grizzly cost from 1000$ to 1100$.
+Grizzly HAPC has 6 transport slots. Tertiary feature to safely bring infantry to the frontlines.
+Grizzly health from 650 to 700.

Badger Recovery Vehicle renamed back into MTP Repair Vehicle.
Badger Recovery ability removed.
Ability to indefinitely resurrect own units, applied on a faction meant to be running expensive and powerful hardware was always extremely overpowered mechanic, regardless of the game.
The only thing keeping it at bay was always player's laziness, and nothing else.


Buratino turn rate from 180 to 90
Buratino prefiredelay of 0.7 seconds for Burst mode.
Buratino buildtime from 10 to 12.
In vanilla, this unit in hands of competent player often used as a hit-n-run semi-artillery, a gameplay completely not fitting the faction. Turn rate halved to prevent such behavior.

Tesla tanks benefit from ERA armor upgrade.
Tesla tank experience value from 50 50 100 150 to 70 70 100 150.
Tesla Tank Vision (AI-related) and Shroud Clearing range from 200 to 230. (20 above attack range, A minor unit AI related change)
Tesla tanks slowly lose their value as game progresss in favor of other options in Russian arsenal.

Mstas from Tier 2 to Tier 1. 



SENTINELS:
Sentinel production time increased from 25 to 30 seconds. 
Sentinel Rate of Fire decreased by 12% (DelayBetweenShots from 4000 to 4500)
Sentinel speed reduced by 9%, from 22 to 20.
Sentinels gain additional 15% health after ERA upgrade. (from 1800 to 2100)
Sentinel Arena cost from 500 to 700.
Sentinel Arena charge amount from 8 to 10.
Arena (Sentinel and Arena Tower, Black Bear uses own special Arena) projectile speed from 800 to 1050.
Arena received secondary damage of 20 with AoE of 20. Combined with GLA Rocket Buggy changes, it now actually works against Rocket Buggies.

Sentinel Warden Missile Pods:
Warden missile pods cost from 500$ to 1000$
Warden Missile ammo count from 4 to 6.
Warden Missile Primary damage of missile from 20 to 15.
Warden Missile Primary damage radius from 5 to 10.
Warden Missile Damage type from ARMOR_PIERCING to SMALL_ARMS
Warden Missile ClipReloadTime from 2000 to 3300.
WardenMissile FLAME damage module Primary Damage from 35 to 30.
WardenMissile FLAME damage module primary damage AoE from 5 to 7.
WardenMissile AA AoE from 10 to 15.

This altogether moves sentinel further away from Kodiaks and Golems.

Shilka price (used to calculate bounties) reduced from 1000$ to 600$.
Rhino price (used to calculate GLA bounties) reduced from 800$ to 700$

Black Bear concept changed to the one I proposed during it's initial implementation in RotR. It makes it significantly more balanced between 1v1's and teamgames, explanations below.
+55% Reload Time
-28% damage per shot
-9% range.
-31% AA missile damage/shot
-7% AA missile rate of fire.
AA missiles inflict AoE damage.
+60% health.
25% less damage from JET_MISSILE (all air-unit missiles, as well as Han gunship cannons)
Flame dmg received from 19% (Sentinel values) to 15%.
Self-repairs after 5 seconds of not receiving damage at the repair speed of MTP. Takes around 1 minute to restore 50% of it's health. Stacks with MTP.
BBear received additional 5% resistance vs dedicated anti-tank weaponry (like Javs, Jagds, etc).
Black Bear uses own arena module that has AoE of 25, reduced ROF, reduced amount of shots. Effective against tightly packed missile salvos.
BBear Buildtime set at 30 seconds.
BBear flame dmg received further from 15% to 13%.
BBear mass increased so it can't be sent flying even by FOAB and similar large explosives.
BBear experience requirements to rank up reduced due to massively reduced firepower.
BBear cost set to 4.200 (3570 post IP).
Black Bear is always visible to everyone in game. If stealthed, it's location is still visible.

Black Bear does not benefit from Chinese Propaganda Rate of Fire bonus. 
This is done in order to soften the effect of % based healing from Propaganda, that BPatch Black Bear gets massive benefits from due to unusually high base health pool.


What you have here is a battering ram. It deals 47% of original black bear's DpS and does not one-shot  medium tanks anymore, which further reduces it's real DPS.
It's still significantly above Sentinel's level. 
This combined with being always visible on the map makes it completely viable for opponent to approach black bear with your ground force/tanks and gun it down and stops it from being an i-win button in intense 1v1's.

At same time, Black Bear becomes more useful in teamgames, where Russia player should not be afraid to use it in front of it's armored column anymore.
Previous black bear's life expectancy in combat conditions in teamgames against high level players was around 4-8 seconds, this one is very resistant to being killed in a single salvo by aircraft/buggies 
or artillery. Ideally, now situation where opponent focuses black bear instead of surrounding units is beneficial to Russian player.


Arms Suppliers always provide 37% of their income regardless of being deployed or not, and another 63% - when deployed.
Arms Suppliers deploy time from 1.8 secons to 1 second. Undeploy time is unchanged.
Arms suppliers model changed to the one from old versions, which is much easier on CPU.

Mobile Topols are not available for construction until Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade.
Topols ignore "select all" order.
==================================================================== BUILDINGS ==========================================================
+Kashtan requires WF
Kashtan spin up time removed. (Still deals 40% less damage than upgraded gattling cannon per second.).
Kashtan vision range reduced from 500 to 360. (average among all defenses in game).


Doesn't make sense for the Radar to have such a low vision range. Observation Post is still vastly superior with it's 600 range.

Arena tower cost from 1200 to 1300$.

Tesla towers overcharge ability added. (credits: Hanfield).

Radar outpost vision range increased from 200 to 300. 
Observation Tower upgrade cost from 200$ to 1000$. Object cost changed as well (for GLA bounties).
One of Russia's weaknesses is it's reconnaissance capabilities. Hence, the cost-efficiency of that stealthed scouting tower was too high.

Tremor buildtime from 45 to 80.
Tremor cost from 4000 to 7500
Tremor health from 4000 to 8000
Tremor cooldown from 7 to 7:30.

Russian Command Center cannot garrison anything.
Russian Command Center shows which Rank 5 breakthrough path is picked.
==================================================================== AIR UNITS ==========================================================
+Hunchbacks can now transport a single VDV vehicle - BMD-1, BMD-4.

Hellion locomotor secondary stats improved. (acceleration, braking).
Hellion experience requirements 0  100 250 400 to 0 150 320 500.
Alot of China/GLA players noticed the Hellion deathballs in the past. One of the main reasons t his happens is due to Hellion damage output combined with it's low experience requirements for a rank 5, which gives you elite hellions in no time.

Hind locomotor brake speed from 50 to 100.
Hind autocannon damage output from 7 to 9 per shot. (reminder - Hinds cost 3500$ with VDV teams inside and require specific Rank 5 Breaktrhrough strategy selected)

Goliath duration from 4 to 2.0 seconds. 
Goliath flares removed.
Goliath does not require unlcok anymore.
Goliath now deflects anti-air missiles during it's active phase (if timed properly by a player).

Hind requires Airborne Breakthrough, and comes with VDV infantry inside.Price adjusted.
Hind Experience requirements from 0 150 300 500 to 0 150 400 650.


Berkut anti-ground machiengun disabled, Berkut cannot attack ground targets anymore. 
Berkuts cost increase from 1300$ to 1700$.
Berkut health reduced from 180 to 135.
Berkuts gain +45 health after Goliath upgrade.
Berkut machinegun removed. 
Berkut AA range reduced from 350 to 300.
Berkut AA minrange from 100 to 35.
Berkut missiles replaced with 57mm autocannons firing sexplosive rounds that can be rearmed only at airfield. 
Berkut autocannons deal one third of their primary damage in a 20 aoe. Their damage type changed from JET_MISSILE to Explosion
Berkut starts with 5 autocannon rounds, gets upgraded to 8 after Tier 1 "Heavy Weapon Systems" upgrade.
Berkut turn rate from 120/90 (normal/damaged) to 180/135.
Berkut speed from 200 to 220.
Berkut vision range from 300 to 330.
Berkut guard mode range from 300 to 420.
It is now a specialist air superiority dogfighter. These things will lose to raptor in 1v1 scenario (and kill each other with a MiG) by being sniped before they can unload their autocannons, but they'll wreck everything there is when in larger groups.



===================================================================UPGRADES==========================================================
Infrared Goggles renamed to Infrared Optics.


Light Armaments upgrade increases Dozer speed by 25%. (slightly above vanilla level)
Light Armaments upgrade increases Mauler movespeed by 10%.
-A slight QoL buff to the BMPs that got their cost-efficiency reduced due to faction theme.

Tunguska, Grizzly Smoke ability locked behind "Heavy Weapon Systems" (Previously known as Guided Missile Systems)

Heavy Weapon Systems upgrade cost from 1000 to 1500$.
Heavy Weapon Systems upgrade research time from 30 to 45.

Coilgun upgrade cost from 2500$ to 4000$.
Coilgun upgrade research time from 60 to 120 seconds.
Coilgun upgrade affects Shocktroopers, replacing rocket rifles with coil rifles. 
Coilgun upgrade provides +10% range increase for Shocktrooper coil rifles.
Coilgun upgrade provides +50% range increase for Shocktrooper Tesla gun.
Instead of nerfing coilgolems into the ground, CoilGolem Rush was nerfed into the ground.
This is an extremely easy and unreasonably powerful rush, that requires no skill ceiling and can be done by literally anyone, which means it breaks PvP games between low to medium skilled players entirely, as well as being hard to counter in higher skilled games depening on map and game mode.


===================================================================GENERAL POWERS==========================================================
Advanced Gunships GP replaced with a Shock division GP. 

Advanced Weapons GP renamed into Experimental Weapons.

Emergency Recovery GP renamed into Veteran Repair Crews.
Emergency recovery Delay from 6.5 seconds to 12.5 seconds (MTP4A/General Power) (time it takes to recovery vehicles).
All Russian husk duration from 40 to 50 seconds.
Recovery GP cooldown from 2:30 to 1:45. (remember, MTPs cant recover anymore).
Recovery ability removed from MTP.
Recovery GP now make MTPs built as Veterans (means +20% health).

Russia GP drop cargo plane health from 1000 to 700.
Russia GP drop cargo plane speed from 125 to 155.
Should make it at least a little harder to use them as FOAB meatshields.

Russia Conscript Drop transport helicopter health from 1000 to 500.
Makes it harder to drop right into the enemy force.

Tu-22 speed from 135 to 115.
Tu-22 missile health from 140 to 110.
Tu-22 missile speed from 230 to 170.
Tu-22 missile range from 2000 to 2400. (so they'll have more time to separate from Tu-22's and so Tu-22 won't distract T0 AA from killing the missiles).
Tu-22 missile primary damage from 300 to 400.
Tu-22 missile primary damage AoE from 30 to 35.
Tu-22 missile secondary damage from 150 to 200.
Tu-22 Backfire Secondary Damage AoE increased from 60 to 65.
Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade arms Tu-22 with nuclear missiles. Slightly more damage and AoE. Fires a single missile with double amount of hp.


Ursa Tank division GP removed. 
Point of Breakthrough GP added. 
Point of Breakthrough gives access to 3 mutually exclusive upgrades - Mechanized Breakthrough, Airborne Breakthrough, Nuclear Breakthrough. Only 1 can be bought during the game.
------README---------
Why was above change done? 
BP Russia got redesigned to work correspondingly to it's main theme. "Powerful steamroller, high health, high armor, unresponsive, slow, predictable". 
The result was a rather more simplified arsenal of available tactics.
So it was decided to provide more versatility to faction upon reaching Rank 5, and thus Rank 5 GP got reworked into three possible options. 
Balancing of new Rank 5 options was done in a such way, that Ursa Division (Veterancy for tanks + Black Bear) still remains superior choice and you can't go wrong with it,
BUT there're also niche, more specialized options now, that Russia player can sacrifice Ursa for depending on the map and situation.



Mechanized Breakthrough upgrade added to Weapons Bunker. 
Requires Point of Breakthrough general power. 
Acts in same manner to Ursa Division GP before.
Affects "all russian armor" - BMPs, Grizzlies, Kodiaks, Golems, Sentinels. Among other things, gives BMPs place after R5.
Additionally increases Kodiak and Grizzly speed by 16%.

Airborne Breakthrough upgrade added in Weapons Bunker, requires Point of Breakthrough.
Replaces Conscripts and VDV RPGs in barracks with with VDV Gunners/VDV RPG Troopers. 
VDV Gunners, RPGs, Shmels and Iglas are built as Veterans.
Unlocks Hind Assault Teams, consisting of Hind Gunships, 4 VDV Gunners, 2 VDV RPG Troopers.
Unlocks BMD1 and BMD4 assault teams. BMD4 comes with 3 VDV Gunners, 2 VDV RPG. BMD1 comes with 4 Iglas, 1 VDV Gunner. More expensive than if built separately, but at a much shorter build time.
All gunships are built as Veterans.
Armored Reserves Drop becomes Armored Assault, all vehicles are dropped with drivers inside.
Airborne Breakthrough increases all Russian GP Cargo/Helicopter health by 25%, back to Vanilla levels. (they got nerfed in a BP).
Sokols receive small thermobaric payload from Airborne Beakthrough.


Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade added to Weapons Bunker.
Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade requires both Point of Breakthrough and ICBM Clearance.
Nuclear Breakthrough turns Missile Silo into Strategic Missile Silo, which reloads automatically, has 3600hp and does not reveal itself on the map to the opponent.
Nuclear Breakthrough increases amount of warheads for ICBM from 5 to 9.
Radiation from Strategic Missile Silo warheads lasts longer than normal ones.
Nuclear Breakthrough increases scatter radius for ICBM warheards from 120 to 250.

Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade issues anti-rads and antidotes to all of Russian infantry and trucks/other unarmored ground vehicle drivers (every single one of them).
Nuclear Breakthrough allows to refurbish Rhinos, Shilkas and Pions in Industrial Plant.
Pion Nuclear Artillery added to Russia. (Credits Alex.Brain).
Around Nuclear Cannon in damage output, 1:30 minutes build time, 3000$ cost, Claymore-like range, 30 second reload time. UNDERGOING TESTING, CAN BE DELETED.

Nuclear Breakthrough unlocks construction of 1 Topol ICBM mobile launchers.
Topol missiles come with a single, but a more powerful warhead with pin-point accuracy. 
Enough damage to one-shot a tunnel together with it's hole.

Nuclear Breakthrough upgrade unlocks Blackout Satellite.
Blackout Satellite radius from 420 to 550.
Blackout Satellite can only be deployed from Command Center. (due to lack of space on right fast access panel).

It's considered a Breakthrough that player chooses when he's low on resources, but requires large amounts of concentrated firepower to break through specific area.
