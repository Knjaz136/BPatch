
==================================================================== GROUND UNITS ==========================================================


RedGuard Bayonet pre-attack delay from 200 to 800.
RedGuard Bayonet ClipReloadTime from 1367 to 767.
(Makes bayonets less godlike in specific 1v1 situations).

+Pyro armorset changed from HumanArmor to ShocktrooperArmor.
+Pyro Health from 100 to 125.
+Pyro buildtime from 8 to 7 seconds.
+Pyros do not deal damage to surroundings on death. Animation stays.
+Pyro cost set at 350$, as in original.

Nukeneers do not deal damage to surroundings on death. Some of animation stays.
Nukeneers gain large radiation fields after Isotope Instability upgrade. (balance testing ongoing).

Volunteers require Breeder Reactor.
Vounteer cost from 1000 to 950 base.

Minigunner teams require Propaganda Center. 
(Makes USA life significantly easier by removing hardcounter to every USA T0 ground unit but Crusader, in 1v1's).

Heroic hackers provide 1/2 of previos exp when killed, at basic Sentinel level now.
(ExperienceValue = 50 100 150 200 (was 400))   

Nuclear Engines are now safe and do not make vehicles explode.

Listening Outpost experiencevalue from 5 to 100. (Overall most powerful scouting unit in the game due to being stealthed. Gives same exp as medium tanks (crusader/leopard), rewards players from hunting those down).

Supply Truck Speed from 60 to 40.
Supply Truck slot count from 6 to 10.
When Supply truck is destroyed, infantry inside receives 60% health damage.
Less very early game crippling rush capability from faction that's already extremely strong at mid to lategame stages.
At same time, these supply trucks can now bring Chinese hordes to the battlefield, 3 trucks can bring you a 30 soldier army.

Troop Crawler long range scanner range reduced from 540 to 360. (by 33%)
Less of stealth detection overspam from China in lategame.

Hopper tank price from 500 to 400. (i.e. total price from 1000 to 800).
Hoppper tank experienceValue upon being killed reduced from 60 60 120 200 to 40 40 80 120.
Hopper tank health from 300 to 250.
Hopper tank buildtime from 10 to 9 seconds (for 2).
Hopper tank Optimized Production values adjusted accordingly. (cost from 1860$ to 1488$, BT from 15 to 14 seconds).
Hopper Tank MoodAttackCheckRate from 1000 to 500. (can now fire properly on the move at their full rate of fire with all bonuses from horde/prop).
Hoppers receive 33% turn rate increase from Nuclear Engines upgrade.
Hopper tank turret turn rate increased from 180 to 270 degrees per second.
Hopper tanks only drop GLA salvage with 50% chance.
HoppperTank armorset changed from TankArmor to LightTankArmor
EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE:
Hopper Tanks receive double bonus from Nationalism, Patriotism and Uranium Shells upgrades. 
Tank description changed accordingly.

This is a very light unit with high damage/cost output potential that should stay viable through entire game.
Reduced cost, experience values and salvage drop rate make it alot less punishing for sending Hoppers into suicide missions and using them as cannon fodder.
At same time, Battlemaster still remains as a slower, much tougher frontal assault option of China.

Gattling tank requires 3/5 shots to get maximum ROF, instead of 4/6.

ECM Tanks cannot disable enemies from firing anymore.
ECM Tank health from 300 to 200.
ECM Tanks get +100 health after Crawler Recon Upgrade
Crawler Recon upgrade from 1000 to 1500$.
Crawler Recon upgrade renamed into Electronic Warfare.
Nerfs ECM tanks earlier in the game (makes USA life significantly easier early on), as well as removes completely imbalanced I-Win button from them (especillay when used with all sorts of healing powers at same time).

China Nuke cannon cost from 2000$ to 2200$
China NC buildtime from 18 to 25 sec.
China NC minrange increased from 150 to 220.
Nuke Cannon damage received from FLAME weapons from 25% to 50%. (due to Russia having to rely on thermobaric barrage vs them instead of Hinds, that went into one of Rank 5 Breakthrough choices).
Nuclear Cannon AoE reduced by 25%. 
Nuclear cannon regains it's AoE after Isotope Instability upgrade.

(Nuke Cannon was bringing it's AoE army-wiping capabilities way too quickly, right after Breeder reactor, with moderate buildtime and cost and no upgrade prerequisites.
Nuke cannons also had a relatively short minrange which made rushing them with units a suicide more often than not.)

Overlord's turn rate increased as much as it's speed together with Nuclear Engines upgrade. (+50%, from 60 to 90).
Overlord's now are capable of firing on the move. Turret's turn rate is still slow, so preferably used against targets in front of your overlord force.
Overlord turret idle scanning interval from 360 to 120. 
(so they don't turn their turret all the way to the back and lose time if an enemy appears in front of them)

Shenlong locomotor equalized with Overlord Locomotor 
Preupgrade - turn rate from 75 to 60.
Post upgrade - turn rate from 75 to 90.


Internet Truck from 400 to 700$ 
Slots from 2 to 3.

==================================================================== AIR UNITS ==========================================================
MiG missile object health nerf to same level as Widowmaker/Sokol/etc.
MiG missile delaybetweenshots from 150 to 100. They fire more concentrated bursts.
To that of a Widowmaker level, otherwise Arena Sentinels become too effective against MiGs. While PDL's don't care, as they don't overkill.

Propaganda Airship health reduced by 33%.
Propaganda Airship gattling damage output vs ground targets increased by 40%.

Propaganda Airship requires Mass Mobilization GP. 
Propaganda Airship requires Propaganda Center instead of Breeder Reactor.
Blimp experiencevalue from 50 50 100 200 to 200 200 300 400. (The Hunter implemented this change into vanilla a while ago, but numbers there are even higher.

Not a Tier 2 AA cannon fodder anymore, and is fast enough to go with the main army.
Also can potentially be used as safeguard vs gunships in early stages, after Gattling upgrade in Propaganda Center.

==================================================================== BUILDINGS ==========================================================
+Chinese mine model replaced with one from Zero Hour. 
+Massive performance increase. 

Gattling Defense requires Warfactory.

Bunker vision range from 360 to 320.

Chinese airfield is usable if Tier 1 structure is not present. MiG FIghters and Han Gunships do not require Propaganda Center. Airfield still requires one.

Nuke Silo health from 4000 to 8000
Nuke Silo buildtime from 45 to 90 seconds.

====================================================================UPGRADES & GENERAL POWERS & OTHER==========================================================
Uranium Shells give +40% damage to Hopper Tanks, instead of +25%.

Nuclear Engines are now safe and do not make vehicles explode.

Isotope Stability renamed into Isotope Instability and affects Nuke Cannons and Nukeneers now. (requires corresponding GP).


Nationalism upgrade increases Dozer speed by 25%. (slightly above vanilla level)

Propaganda Spotlight unlocks Patriotism upgrade.
Patriotism upgrade increases Horded vehicle attack range by 7% and rate of fire by additional 15%.
Patriotism upgrade costs 4000 and has 2 minutes 30 seconds research time, it is meant to be a lategame benefit from Propaganda Spotlight.
Patriotism upgrade requires Nationalism upgrade to be researched in order to appear in the list of upgrades.
Propaganda Spotlight all self-heal related buffs from vanilla are removed.
War Propaganda does not heal units anymore until Nationalism upgrade is researched. Was considered an imbalanced mechanic in 1v1's at higher level of skill.
Propaganda Spotlight cooldown from 1:00 to 1:20.

Mass Mobilization now reduces vehicle cost by 7% (when produced in pairs).
Mass Mobilization hopper tanks and battlemasters  require propaganda center.

ECM Drop tooltips updated to properly reflect the effects of this GP.

MineDrop GP Plane health from 750 to 400.
MineDrop Plane speed reduced by 20% (from 125 to 100).
Much harder to use it as a carpet bomber or warfactory blocker.

ECM Satellite WAS NOT ADDED TO THE BPATCH AFTER IT WAS ADDED TO VANILLA. It's current vanilla iteration is completely imbalanced - uncounterable, on-click ETA of few seconds, quick EMP shutdown in large AoE,  AA shutdown + ECM effect.
The original ECM drop that existed pre-1.87 is alot more balanced in this regard and alot less toxic on the receiving end.
